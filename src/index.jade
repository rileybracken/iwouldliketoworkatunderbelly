                p A little bit about me, I currently work as a Front End Developer in St George Utah. I have worked for this company since May of 2013. Primarily while I have been here I have done work in AngularJS, HTML and CSS. I do have experience in Backbone, React and Knockout as well. The primary API I use to connect my Angular work to is Ruby on Rails, although I have worked in NodeJS as well.

              p When I'm not working on various projects I like to take advantage of the Southern Utah weather. I love Mountain Biking, Road Biking and riding my 2010 Triumph Bonneville. I am a National Parks Season pass holder 4 years running now and try to get to Zion National Park as often as possible. I am the father of a wonderful 3 year old girl and have been married for 6 years.
